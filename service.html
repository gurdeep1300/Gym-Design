                            <br> First, a little anatomy lesson. Along with muscles in the lower back, these key abdominals make up your core.

                            <b>External Obliques:</b> The outer layer of the abs on your sides; these run diagonally downward.<br>
                            <b>Internal Obliques:</b> Just underneath the external obliques, these run diagonally up your sides.<br>
                            <b>Rectus Abdominis:</b> Two paired sheets of muscle from the ribs to the pelvis that flex you forward. (These are the â€³six-pack" muscle most people think of as abs.)<br>
                            <b>Transversus Abdominis:</b> The deepest ab muscle, which wraps around the waist to support the spine.</p>

                        <p class="leading-relaxed text-base">The muscles of the back are a group of strong, paired muscles that lie on the posterior aspect of the trunk. They provide movements of the spine, stability to the trunk, as well as the coordination between the movements of the
                            limbs and trunk. The back muscles are divided into two large groups:<br>
                            <strong>The extrinsic (superficial) back muscles: </strong> which lie most superficially on the back. These muscles are also called immigrant muscles, since they actually represent muscles of the upper limb that have migrated
                            to the back during fetal development. These muscles are divided into superficial and intermediate.<br> <strong>Intrinsic (deep) back muscles: </strong> which are also called true back muscles. They are located deep to the extrinsic
                            muscles, being separated from them by the thoracolumbar fascia. Their primary function is to produce movements of the vertebral column. These muscles are divided into superficial, deep, and deepest layers.</p>

                        <p class="leading-relaxed text-base">The shoulder is one of the largest and most complex joints in the body. The shoulder joint is formed where the humerus (upper arm bone) fits into the scapula (shoulder blade), like a ball and socket. Other important bones in the
                            shoulder include: <br>#The acromion is a bony projection off the scapula.<br> #The clavicle (collarbone) meets the acromion in the acromioclavicular joint.<br> #The coracoid process is a hook-like bony projection from the scapula.</p>

                        <p class="leading-relaxed text-base">Anatomically, the leg is defined as the region of the lower limb below the knee. It consists of a posterior, anterior and lateral compartment. In accordance, the muscles of the leg are organized into three groups:<br> Anterior
                            (dorsiflexor) group, which contains the tibialis anterior, extensor digitorum longus, fibularis tertius and extensor hallucis longus. Posterior (plantar flexor) group, which consists of a superficial layer comprised of the
                            gastrocnemius, plantaris and soleus, and a deep layer comprised of tibialis posterior, flexor hallucis longus, popliteus and flexor digitorum longus muscles. Lateral (fibular) group, which consists of fibularis longus and fibularis
                            brevis. The muscles of the leg produce different movements in the ankle and foot that are important for many activities such as walking, running and dancing. It is important to consider muscle groups as functional units. While
                            the individual muscles in each compartment have additional functions, the primary function of each compartment is the most important thing to remember<br> The anterior group consists of muscles that mainly produce dorsiflexion
                            of the foot at the ankle joint, an action particularly important for the swing phase of the gait cycle in which the leg is lifted off from the ground.<br> The posterior group of muscles primarily produce plantar flexion of
                            the foot at the ankle joint, an action important for the toe-off phase of the gait cycle, in which the foot prepares to leave the ground. Plantar flexion is also important for maintaining posture while standing and walking.
                            The lateral group consists of muscles that mainly produce an eversion of the foot at the subtalar joint. This action plays an important role in maintaining balance while standing on one leg or walking on rough surfaces.</p>
